# pysnap-toolbox
A lightweight python wrapper for ESA SNAP software using [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) config files as input files. The goal of this script is to allow for easier sharing and automation of full SNAP workflows. This includes external software that isn't controlled by SNAP/GPT such as SNAPHU phase unwrapping.
